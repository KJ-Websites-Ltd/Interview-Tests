Q3. Quality assurance
=======================

Describe a situation where you think Behaviour Driven Development could be a particularly good or bad approach to a software project.

Response
=========
Behavior driven design is an updated test driven design methodology but more team based that aims to integrate the users of any particular system into direct conversation with the developers.

As such any content or admin management system would gain from this approach, so that the development team can create an application that is most suited for any admin team to use. Therefore with adequate unit testing as well and common sense development processed these will gain greatly from such an approach and continued communication as the project goes on. The communication between users and development team is the most important aspect of this.

This is however not a catch all, for other projects, such as front end websites or customer facing applications where the user base will be much larger using BDD would be expensive and time consuming and as such UX and A-B testing would be more appropriate and a better use of time and funding.
