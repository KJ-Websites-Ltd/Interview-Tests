Q3. Quality assurance
=======================

Describe a situation where you think Behaviour Driven Development could be a particularly good or bad approach to a software project.

Response
=========
Behaviour driven design is an updated test driven design methology but more team based  that aims to integrate the users of any particyular system into direct conversation with the developers and as such any content or admin management system would gain from this approach, so that the development team can create an application that is most suited for any admin team to use. Therefore with addiquate unit testing as well and common sense development processed these will gain greatly from such an approach. 

This is however not a catch all, for other projects, such as front end websites or customer facing applications where the user base will be much larger using BDD would be expensive and time consuming and as such UX testing would be more appriate and a better use of time and funding.
