Summary
======

This basic single page application simply creates a html template for a product details page that retrieves a product details from a php script that outputs some JSON and then uses JS mustache to populate the page with dynamic data.

This uses:

Jquery for general dom manipulation ease
Kube for CSS framework
Mustache for front end templating


I have built the CSS using SASS but the JS I didnt feel needed compiling for building using ECMA6 as the functionality is simple.
