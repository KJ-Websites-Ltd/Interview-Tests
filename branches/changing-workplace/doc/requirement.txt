Hi Candidate

Please find a link to a zip file containing two files - an HTML file and a JavaScript file.

The HTML file contains a basic structure to load in the JavaScript file and call to a function called getPopulationByContinent().

The JS file contains an ES6 class that contains a constructor, which itself has an arbitrary data structure of geographical data, and some of the hierarchy levels have a population figure.  It also contains a placeholder for the getPopulationByContinent method.

We would like you to write functionality to process the geographical data and calculate total populations grouped by continent.  For example, Asia = 67625000.

Rules:

You can't modify the supplied geographicData data structure at all to make your solution work
You can assume that the top level is always a continent
Think about how your solution would work if more levels were added to the tree

You can present the answer however you like, and there is no time limit..
