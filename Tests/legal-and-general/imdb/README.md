IMDB Top Twelve Films
=======================

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Synopsis
========

This small application simply fetches a JSON feed from an external source (originally http://www.myapifilms.com/ but stored locally) and then proceeds to list these film as links to the IMDB page for each one in a responsive CSS Grid layout.

This is my first development using React so best React practices might not be adhered to, although this is still a very small code base so my javascript practice should be solid.

I have only needed to update a few files on the server to get this working, and to start the application you simply need to enter this directory using the terminal and use:

> npm start

Files updated or created
========================

* public/data/top-ten-films.json
* public/index.html
* src/App.scss
* src/App.css
* src/index.js
* src/App.js

This application is also available via BitBucket GIT if required.
